Introduction
RxJS is one of the hottest libraries in web development today. Offering a powerful, functional approach for dealing with events and with integration points into a growing number of frameworks, libraries, and utilities, the case for learning Rx has never been more appealing. Couple this with the ability to utilize your knowledge across nearly any language, having a solid grasp on reactive programming and what it can offer seems like a no-brainer.
But...
Learning RxJS and reactive programming is hard. There's the multitude of concepts, large API surface, and fundamental shift in mindset from an imperative to declarative style. This site focuses on making these concepts approachable, the examples clear and easy to explore, and features references throughout to the best RxJS related material on the web. The goal is to supplement the official docs and pre-existing learning material while offering a new, fresh perspective to clear any hurdles and tackle the pain points. Learning Rx may be difficult but it is certainly worth the effort!

Concepts
Without a solid base knowledge of how Observables work behind the scenes, it's easy for much of RxJS to feel like 'magic'. This section helps solidify the major concepts needed to feel comfortable with reactive programming and Observables.
